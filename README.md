# Introduction
Everyday, I use Emacs as the universal tool to do most work, including
- editing all kinds of source codes (e.g., **Matlab**, **C/C++**, **Latex**, **Python**, **Lua**, **Html**, **Css**);
- editing codes on remote server using **Tramp**;
- simulating shells for running **Matlab**, **Python** and **Zsh**;
- organizing folders and documents on my Mac;
- taking notes and tracking progress using **Org**;
- maintaining **Git** repositories.

The reason I like Emacs is to be **focused and
productive**. Most time I have only two softwares running, **iTunes**
for playing music and **Emacs** for working. Always staying in a
single Emacs environment can largely save your time in switching
between different softwares and reducing the distraction from other
sources of information. Within Emacs, you can develop your favorite
work-flow and stick with the same key shortcuts for different tasks.

# Emacs Version
I recommend to use the Emacs version from
[Railwaycat's Port](https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port),
which provides a native GUI support for latest Mac OSX.

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/zhfe99/prelude ~/.emacs.d`

# Organization
My configuration follows the default setting of the popular
[prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) package. My
personal modification can be found in the sub-folder `personal/` and `personal/3rd`.
