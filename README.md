# Introduction
Everyday, I use Emacs as the universal tool to do most work, including
- editing all kinds of source codes (e.g., **Matlab**, **C/C++**, **Latex**, **Python**, **Lua**, **Html**, **Css**);
- editing codes on remote server using **Tramp**;
- simulating shells for running **Matlab**, **Python** and **Zsh**;
- organizing folders and documents on my Mac;
- taking notes and tracking progress using **Org**;
- maintaining **Git** repositories.

The reason I like Emacs is to be **focused and
productive**. Most time I have only two softwares running, **iTunes**
for playing music and **Emacs** for working. Always staying in a
single Emacs environment can largely save your time in switching
between different softwares and reducing the distraction from other
sources of information. Within Emacs, you can develop your favorite
work-flow and stick to the same key shortcuts for different tasks.
